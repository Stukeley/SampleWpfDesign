# SampleWpfDesign
Sample MainWindow design I made using Material Design for WPF.

# This is just an example
I just picked a random color palette and threw some random objects onto the main grid.

I can create many more objects, including Buttons, Lists, Trees, Cards, Data Grids and many more.  
The side menu is animated - it expands on clicking the hamburger button.  
The TODO list is animated as well upon marking an item as complete.  
The window has custom Maximize and Exit buttons, and thus has no classic Windows-style border.
